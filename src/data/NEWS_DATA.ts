        'Nigeria’s President-elect, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu has promised to be a servant to Nigerians and not a leader, saying that a renewed hope has dawn in the nation. Tinubu, while given his acceptance speech in Abuja on Wednesday morning said he was profoundly humbled by the mandate given to him to be the 16th president of Nigeria. The president-elect described his election as a serious mandate, saying he accepted the mandate to serve Nigeria. “This is a serious mandate, I hereby accept it to serve you, to be your servant and not be your leader, to work with you and make Nigeria a great country,” he said. Tinubu appealed to Peter Obi of the Labour Party, Atiku Abubakar of the PDP and other contestants to team up with him to build the nation. “I appeal to my fellow contestants, let us team up together, this is the only nation we have, it is one country and we must build together, we must work together to put broken pieces together, we must work for the unity, happiness and harmony,” he said. He urged them to collaborate with him to build the nation, saying “we have what it takes, what is needed-knowledge, creativity, determination, we are the same country, I promise I will work with you to make Nigeria the destination for those at home to return home to contribute to the development of Nigeria.” To the youths, Tinubu promised to work with them, saying he would pay undivided attention to their education. “I will pay undivided attention to your education, four years course will be four years course, no more strike, your universities will have autonomy, no more selling of handouts, our lecturers must be authors. I know where it pains you and I believe you will see the reward of your election,” he added. He commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his support, saying he is a great patriot.',

        'LAGOS. -As the application opens for the 7th Cohort Fellowship of Teach for Nigeria, Folawe Omikunle, CEO of Teach For Nigeria, has assured that the programme would continue to spread and provide excellent education to children in underserved communities across the country. Teach For Nigeria, a non-profit organization, focused on building a movement of leaders committed to improving foundational learning outcomes and life opportunities for low-income children in Nigeria over the weekend announced the launch of the 7th cohort of its fellowship. The Teach For Nigeria Fellowship programme is a two-year full-time paid commitment that is designed to build a movement of leaders who will work towards eliminating educational inequity by teaching in under-served schools in low-income communities across Nigeria. The selected fellows will be posted to teach students in under-resourced schools across Lagos and Ogun states. Speaking during a hybrid recruitment launch of the 7th Cohort, Folawe Omikunle, CEO of Teach For Nigeria said, “We are committed to building a nationwide movement of leaders to provide an excellent, equitable education to all of Nigeria’s children. “Through our two-year Fellowship, we are driving long-term systemic change. Our Fellows are placed in underserved schools to work relentlessly to transform the lives of their students. We also train, equip and support them through a combination of pre-service training and ongoing support. We are about to usher in a new set of leaders in the educational sector and we are excited to begin the process of inspiring leaders.” Daniel Ochekwu, a 2019 TFN alumnus and guest speaker at the event, said, “My two years as a fellow at TFN made me grow exponentially. It helped me learn more about life and improved my ability to empathise, identify and solve problems. “Teach For Nigeria supports you to run with your innovations beyond the fellowship. The resources (people and material) Teach for Nigeria gave me were enormous.’’ POLL The Teach For Nigeria Fellowship programme continues to serve as a private-sector-led solution to bridge the learning gap and address the education inequity in Nigeria. The fellowship is open to outstanding young professionals including non-teachers and existing teachers interested in being part of the movement to end educational inequity in Nigeria. In the last six years, Teach for Nigeria has successfully placed and supported 1140 fellows to lead significant academic and non-academic outcomes in 600+ underserved schools, impacting over 160,000 students in Lagos, Ogun, Kaduna and Oyo states.

        'The Leadership of the National Youth Council of Nigeria has congratulated the good people of Nigeria for the successful conclusion of the 2023 presidential election. In a Statement issued by the Vice President North Central of the Apex Youth Body, Amb. Akoshile Mukhtar; the organization stated that as for us, the youth of Nigeria, it was a peaceful exercise in line with our months of campaigns and engagements calling for the youths not to be allowed to be used for violence as they deserves some accolades. It must be pointed out that there is no election without winners and losers and some misgivings will always be generated from winning and losing. We however call on all and sundry, especially the political actors to refrain from making inflammatory statements to further heat up the polity and disrupt the peace we enjoy as a people, but rather follow the legally provided processes for seeking redress where their grievances are genuine and backed with evidence. We Congratulate the president-elect Senator Bola Tinubu on his emergence and urge him to reach out and heal all wounds like the father he has always been. We call on all Nigerians and lovers of Nigeria to gear up for the task ahead, of building a new Nigeria as no individual or group can claim monopoly of having the capacity to develop Nigeria. This is a task for all. We urge INEC to take genuine criticism on board to improve future elections, while congratulating them on the improvements seen in this election cycle. No doubt the people of Nigeria have spoken and the youth align with their stance in the interest of the continued corporate existence of Nigeria. We shall resist any person or group of persons who avail themselves for enemies of the state to push their agenda. Amb Akoshile Mukhtar recalled that the NYCN in collaboration with the Abuja Residents Youth Association recently presented a peace declaration letter to the FCTA at a Peace walk promising that the Youths will not allow themselves to be used as electorate violence and still stand to defend that all the time.',

      content:
        'A Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) and former Senator, Victor Ndoma-Egba, has condemned in strong terms the call by some opposition parties for the outright cancellation of the presidential election held on Saturday, February 25, 2023. Describing the demand for the cancellation of the election as treasonable, unpatriotic and selfish, Ndoma-Egba, an erstwhile Senate Leader and former Chairman Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), wondered why anyone would want to truncate the country’s democratic process at this crucial stage. The national chairmen of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Labour Party (LP) and Africa Democratic Congress (ADC), Iyorchis Ayu, Julius Abure and Ralph Nwosu respectively, while addressing a world Press Conference at Transcorp Hilton Hotel in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja on Tuesday had called for total cancellation of the presidential poll conducted last Saturday. They also passed a vote of no confidence on the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu because, in their words: “The conduct of the February 25, 2023 election has been marred by widespread violence, rigging, intimidation of voters, doctoring of the results, and violation of the laid down electoral process, which was communicated by the national electoral body, INEC.” But Ndoma-Egba argued that “There is no provision in our laws to grant such a demand which is preposterous and selfish. It is even treasonable as they seek to truncate our democratic process and therefore destroy democracy.” Ndoma-Egba, who is the Secretary of the Campaign Planning Directorate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) said, “Democracy is about processes not outcomes. They should allow the processes play out. There are copious legal provisions available to them to ventilate their grievances.” He stated further that the call for the cancellation of the presidential election was needless and not in the best interest of the country, the ex-Senate Leader advised that political leaders should desist from making provocative and inciting utterances that are capable of engendering crisis or violence. He said what should be paramount in the minds of all well-meaning Nigerians at this point in time should be how to join hands and work together with whoever emerges as the next president to build and reposition Nigeria for greatness. Meanwhile, the APC presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has been declared the winner of the election after securing a total of 8,805,420 votes upon the conclusion of the state-by-state collation of results at the National Collation Centre Abuja. Presidential flag bearer of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar, scored 6,984,290 votes to place second, while the LP standard-bearer, Peter Obi, polled 6,093,962 votes to come third.',

        'By Monday Ijeh The Nigeria Police has reacted to trending news in some sections of the media over alleged arrest of some individuals with electoral materials and some Bi-Modal Voters Accreditation System, BVAs, machines in Maitaima area of Abuja. Police spokesperson, CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, said this on Wednesday in Abuja while asking the public to discountenance reports of the arrest. Explaining what really happened, the police spokesperson said operatives of the Force Intelligence Bureau (FIB) had visited the location, interviewed the occupants and conducted a search on the house following a report by residents of the area of suspicious activities. According to him, in the course of the search, some electoral materials and BVAs machines were discovered in their possession. “When contacted, the Independent National Electoral Commission, confirmed that the occupants of the house are staff of Emperor Technology, outsourcing engineering services to INEC and were immediately released,” he said. He said the report was a false and misconstrued narrative, and therefore, called on the public to discountenance it. Adejobi urged reporters and media houses to endeavor to carry out due diligence and ascertain the veracity of an information before spreading, to avoid being victims of the “breaking news syndrome”. He called on the public to avoid creation and spread of misinformation and disinformation that could cause disaffection between the populace and state actors. (NAN)',

        'By Lydia Ngwakwe Guaranty Trust Bank, GTB Ltd. said it had contacted Twitter for the identification of the owner of the fake account who published that it gave N500 million new naira notes to one of the presidential candidates in last Saturday’s presidential election. The bank said this in a statement on Wednesday while emphatically denying the claim that it gave the N500 million to the presidential candidate as published by a Twitter account with the name: @ifygold21. But the GTB said the claim was not only completely false but was designed to bring the image of the bank and its officers to disrepute. The bank further noted that the fact that the post referred to Segun Agbaje as its Managing Director further exposed the ignorance of the sponsors of the Twitter account. “The attention of Guaranty Trust Bank Ltd., (the “Bank”) has been drawn to a spurious post on Twitter by @ifygold21 alleging that the Bank gave the new Naira notes in the total sum of ₦500 million to one of the leading presidential candidates in the ongoing General Elections, on the eve of the elections and at the order of a high-ranking government official. “The Bank wishes to refute this claim in its entirety and state categorically that it is completely false and it’s designed to bring the image of the Bank and its officers to disrepute. “The fact that the post refers to Segun Agbaje as Managing Director of the Bank further exposes the sponsors of the content as uninformed and malicious. ” Accordingly, we would like to clarify that Miriam Olusanya is the Managing Director of the Bank and has been at the helm of affairs of the Bank in that capacity since her appointment in Aug. 2021. “Our preliminary findings show that the post was made using a faceless bot account, evidently operated by unscrupulous persons intent on propagating falsehood and inciting well-meaning Nigerians to their malicious ends. “This is clearly unwarranted and poses a serious threat to our continuing operations, with incalculable risks to lives and property,” it said. The bank said that it had taken the post seriously and had escalated it to all concerned parties including Twitter, for the identification of the owner of the fake account and consequent legal action. The bank noted that its Nigerian operations supported a diverse customer base with varied business interests in communities across the country and as such, remained available to everyone. The bank urged its Customers and the banking public to kindly disregard this unsubstantiated claim in its entirety. “Guaranty Trust Bank hereby restates its commitment to being a responsible, non-partisan corporate citizen with strict adherence to the highest standards of global best practice as well as sound corporate governance in all aspects of our business operations,” it said.

Ganduje said this while reacting to declaration of Tinubu as president -elect by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC in a statement he issued early Wednesday morning in Kano. In the statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr Abba Anwar, Ganduje described the emergence of Tinubu as the emergence of true democrat. “Tinubu’s decades-long fight for the restoration of democracy in the country, is well understood by Nigerians. Hence we see wisdom and valid reason for entrusting our future to him.” While assuring that, the President-elect would evolve strategies in facing problems plaguing the nation, Ganduje lauded the party leadership and membership for standing firm to this point. Tinubu, according to Ganduje “Is a master strategist, a builder of man and space, an acknowledged brilliant political leader, a leader with national spread, an enduring and ensuring promoter of sustainable democracy and development and a skilful mover.” With the above and many other factors that worked around the emerged winner of the presidential poll, Ganduje explained further that, “With our President-elect, Tinubu, leading the largest democracy in Africa, our continent will definitely benefit from the wealth of experience for the development of the continent.” “Tinubu’s victory will not only benefit our motherland Nigeria, it will at the same time be a morale booster for Africa, as a continent and for the practice of global democracy,” he concluded. Ganduje applauded the hard political struggle and commitment of Tinubu’s political dynasty, which formed elements from across the nation, in making sure that the Presidential candidate won the entire process. “Tinubu’s genuine investment in human, national development and national integration played some critical roles in endearing him to all sections of the country,” he observed. Adding that, “Tinubu’s decades-long fight for the restoration of democracy in the country, is well understood by Nigerians.

        'For much of his political career, Nigerian President-elect Bola Tinubu has exerted power from behind the scenes, widely regarded as a “godfather” who uses an extensive patronage network to back candidates for office. Tinubu’s support helped outgoing leader Muhammadu Buhari win two terms in office, in 2015 and 2019. And since he bowed out as Lagos governor in 2007, Tinubu has picked every subsequent winning candidate to run Africa’s biggest city. That power will now be tested as Tinubu attempts to tackle Nigeria’s crises and improve on Buhari’s lacklustre record. Nigeria is beset by armed groups that have rendered swathes of the country ungovernable, while its economy is barely keeping up with population growth amid surging inflation and crippling cash shortages after a botched introduction of new bank notes. Many of these problems worsened under Buhari, on whose party ticket Tinubu ran. But asked at a weekend news briefing why voters should elect him, he distanced himself from the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) party he helped create. “I am not the party,” he said. “My track record should speak for me. Look at Lagos: Before I came, we had dead bodies on the road, a chaotic traffic system, robbery daytime and nighttime.” “Come on: clap for me,” he added in an appearance typical of the hubris that often marks leaders of Africa’s top oil producer and most populous country. While Tinubu missed several of his party’s big campaign events and has appeared frail during some appearances, his speech often slow and slurred, he has repeatedly brushed aside concerns about his health. Few doubted Tinubu’s well-resourced campaign would triumph in a country in which the ruling party has a major advantage, despite strong challenges from Atiku Abubakar, of the former ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP), and Peter Obi, of the insurgent Labour Party. Tinubu supporters portray him as an effective administrator with a track record of picking competent technocrats. Critics say he awards lucrative contracts and plum jobs to loyalists and has in the past turned to so-called area boys, who informally control the streets of Lagos and attend his rallies en masse, to intimidate opponents if he does not get his way. The 70-year-old does not respond to such allegations, tending instead to ignore them. A spokesman for Tinubu’s campaign did not respond to repeated requests for comment. A biography on his campaign website says Tinubu was born in Lagos in 1952, to a Muslim family from the Yoruba ethnic group, the majority in southwest Nigeria. Others say he is much older. In the 1970s, he emigrated to the United States, where he worked as a dishwasher, taxi driver and night guard to fund his studies. He graduated from Chicago State University in 1979 with a degree in business administration. After working for U.S. consultancy firms, he returned to Nigeria in the 1980s and worked for the branch of the Mobil oil company as an auditor. He first got involved in politics in the 1990s and was elected governor of Lagos when military rule ended in 1999. He served two terms. His supporters say he improved roads, trash collection and other services in the chaotic city, but many Lagosians say it remains deeply dysfunctional. Others wonder whether, with the exorbitant cost of contracts – some to companies in which his close allies have a controlling interest – the city really got value for money. A light rail project he started has not been completed after 20 years. Tinubu’s support for Buhari, whose government struggled to tackle Nigeria’s major economic and security problems, also did little to increase confidence in him among many of the 93.4 million registered voters.',
